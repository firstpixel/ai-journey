## Projects

### Neural Networks
- **[Neural network C](https://github.com/firstpixel/c-neural-network/tree/main)**  
  *This project implements a simple neural network in C that learns basic logic functions (XOR, XNOR, OR, AND, NOR, NAND). It uses a single hidden layer with backpropagation and momentum-based updates, along with Xavier initialization for the weights. The network also supports checkpointing so that training can be resumed from a saved state.*
- **[Neural network Python](https://github.com/firstpixel/neural-network)**  
  *This project is a Python port of a C feed-forward neural network featuring one hidden layer, backpropagation with momentum, Xavier weight initialization, checkpointing for saving/loading parameters, and custom logic for logical operations (XOR, XNOR, OR, AND, NOR, NAND).*

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **[LLM Project Name](https://github.com/yourusername/llm-project)**  
  *Project overview and key takeaways.*

### Text to Speech Models (TTSs)
- **[F5-TTS-pt-br](https://huggingface.co/firstpixel/F5-TTS-pt-br)**  
  *Project to learn how to train a TTS Model. Contains pre-trained weights for Portuguese BR in F5-TTS. It only speaks portuguese as it is a preliminary test.

### Agents
- **[Agent Project Name](https://github.com/yourusername/agent-project)**  
  *Short description, technologies used, etc.*

### Other Projects
- **[Other AI Project Name](https://github.com/yourusername/other-ai-project)**
